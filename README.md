Each top-level directory in this repository provides the required scripts and data to perform a specific analysis / experiment described in the associated paper.

| Directory                        | Description |
|:---------------------------------|:------------|
| [`experiments/`](experiments/)   | Study the prevalence of quantum-specific smells on quantum programs |
| [`samples/`](samples/)           | Examples used in Section IV in the associated paper |
| [`subjects/`](subjects/)         | The subjects (i.e., quantum programs) used in the empirical evaluation |
| [`survey/`](survey/)             | Questions asked and answers provided by participants of the survey |
| [`tools/`](tools/)               | Local directory that keeps all required tools and environments to run those tools |
| [`utils/`](utils/)               | Utility scripts that are used by more than one experiment / analysis |

Each top-level directory has the following structure:
- `README.md`: Describes the directory and elements that can be found in the directory (data, scripts, etc), and provides documentation of those elements, e.g., examples on how to run a script, what does a script generate, etc.
- `data/`: Data files used as inputs by the scripts and/or automatically generated by the scripts of each analysis to facilitate faster processing.
  * `data/FILE-SPECS.md`: Defines the format of all CSV files in each `data` directory.
- `scripts/`: Bash or Python scripts for performing the corresponding analysis / experiments.
- `statistics/`: R scripts that process the data and produce numbers, tables, and figures for the associated paper.
