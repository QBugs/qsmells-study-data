# Samples / Examples of each Quantum-specific Smell

Each directory (named after the quantum-specific smell) contains the examples used in the associated paper (Section IV).  In each directory, i.e., for each quantum-specific smell `s`, there are two main Python files `s-smelly.py` and `s-fixed.py`.  The former is a program example that exhibits the smell `s` and the latter is the same program example but smell-free.  The remaining files are automatically generated by execution of these two Python files.

For example, assuming `s` is `roc`, one could execute `roc-smelly.py` as

```bash
# Load utility script
source "../utils/scripts/utils.sh"

# Activate custom Python virtual environment
_activate_virtual_environment

# Run the program example
python row-smelly.py

# Deactivate custom Python virtual environment
_deactivate_virtual_environment
```

which generates / draws the quantum circuit of the program in different formats, one per file:

- ASCII art, `roc-smelly.txt`.
- Raw uncompiled latex output, `roc-smelly.tex`.
- Image with color rendered purely in Python using matplotlib, `roc-smelly.pdf` (folded/pagination disabled) and `roc-smelly-folded.pdf`.
- Execution matrix (see Section IV.A.1), `roc-smelly.csv`.

The execution of the `roc-fixed.py` script is performed with the same set of commands (except `python row-fixed.py`) and it also generates the same set of files, but with the suffix `-fixed`.
