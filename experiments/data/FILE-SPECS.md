# Specifications of data files

## [`generated/qsmell-metrics/data.csv`](generated/qsmell-metrics/data.csv)

File automatically generated by the [`../scripts/run-qsmell-on-all-subjects-all-metrics.sh`](../scripts/run-qsmell-on-all-subjects-all-metrics.sh) script.

- `name`: name of the quantum program / algorithm
  * factor: e.g., "grover"

- `runtime`: time, in seconds, it took to compute `metric` on `name`
  * numerical, e.g., 5

- `metric`: smell metric acronym
  * factor: e.g., "ROC"

- `value`: smell metric value
  * numerical, e.g., 145

Note: this file aggregates all `data.csv` files under `generated/qsmell-metrics/<metric>/<name>/data.csv`, which are automatically generated by the [../scripts/run-qsmell.sh](../scripts/run-qsmell.sh) script.

## [`peer-evaluation-of-qsmell-v0.csv`](peer-evaluation-of-qsmell-v0.csv) and [`peer-evaluation-of-qsmell-v1.csv`](peer-evaluation-of-qsmell-v1.csv)

File manually created by two authors (i.e., raters) of the associated paper.  The [`peer-evaluation-of-qsmell-v0.csv`](peer-evaluation-of-qsmell-v0.csv)
file contains the first iteraction's data per author while computing the metric of each smell.  The [`peer-evaluation-of-qsmell-v1.csv`](peer-evaluation-of-qsmell-v1.csv) file contains the second iteraction's data, per author, after both met and reviewed all computed metrics.

- `rater`: rater's name
  * factor, e.g., "turing" (Note: true names redacted for anonymity)

- `name`: name of the quantum program / algorithm
  * factor: e.g., "grover"

- `metric`: smell metric acronym
  * factor: e.g., ROC

- `value `: smell metric value
  * numerical, e.g., 145
